== Operation Banana Hammock ==


A while back Brucon asked Eireann and I to give a little workshop on Scapy
at their 0x05 conference.

The idea behind this workshop spawned from a gentlemans challenge. Can you
perform all the steps in an HTTP request from the very bottom of the stack (ARP)
all the way through to the top (HTTP)...in Scapy.

This is the result of that gentlemans challenge. 

Questions and feedback are very welcome.
